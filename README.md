1. Shoutouts and Acknowledgements

Couldn't be making this without the help of Brainstation and my amazing Educators and Teaching Assistants - Noor (Nooruddin), Joe (Scribbio), Felipe (felipefranco-ldn), and Sammy! You guys have been amazing and have really pushed me into a creative but technical sphere.

2. What's this then?

The aim of this project, currently called Bondo but very subject to change as it sounds like a glue company, is to get first generation migrants and expats connected through a networking platform. They can find people from similar walks to life and connect to them, chat to them, and organise and go to events with them.

Key bits of functionality include:

A log-in page, where you can add your details and this is stored in a warehouse in the back-end.

A connect page, where you can see your own location, click on markers of people next to you, and connect with them.

A chat page, where you can talk to people that you've connected to.

A meet page, where you can organise and pin events next to each other and meet up with people close by.

We are still in progress with all of these bits, updates will be recorded at the bottom of this readme.

3. Technologies used

This app currently uses react, knex, axios, postcode.io, mapbox.gl and react-mapbox-gl, with an SQL database on the back end. I'm planning on adding sockets.io to the mix when chat functionality comes to life.

4. Progress

11/04: First readme add. Connect functionality added, but still needs some more functionality in terms of connecting to specific users. Profile adding is next up on the list!

5. Other bits that come with React as charged

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
